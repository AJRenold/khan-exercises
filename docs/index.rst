The Khan Academy's Exercise Framework
=====================================

khan-exercises is an `MIT Licensed <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License>`_ framework for building generative academic exercises. This framework, together with the exercises themselves, can be used completely independently of the Khan Academy application to run a seemingly infinite number of practice problems for each exercise.

API Documentation
*****************

If you're looking for reference information, look here. If something you're looking for isn't here, consider adding it to the documentation.

The framework exists in two components:

* HTML markup for specifying exercises.
* A jQuery plugin for generating a usable, interactive, exercise from the HTML markup.
